i/p -> data_sets/intermediate/pass1_gender_salary.csv

data set -> 
data_sets/input/misc/monga_bay/asian.csv
data_sets/input/misc/monga_bay/white.csv
data_sets/input/misc/monga_bay/native_americans.csv
data_sets/input/misc/monga_bay/hispanic.csv
data_sets/input/misc/monga_bay/black.csv

processing -> For a given last name, find the best race possible, also use rank_percent to improve results
Ex :- 'smith' as a surname are found in both Whites and AfricanAmerican, but 22.2 percent of all 'smith''s are identified as AfricanAmerican where as 73.3 percent of all 'smith''s are identified as Whites. Hence race is evaluated as 'White' for 'smith' rather that AfricanAmerican
